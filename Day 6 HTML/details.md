# My Web Dev Journey: Day 6

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation of my sixth day on the web development journey! Today was focused on implementing HTML tags and SEO practices I've learned in the previous five days into a website project.

## What I Did Today

### 1. Implementing HTML Tags

I dedicated today to utilizing key HTML tags I've learned so far, focusing on `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<h1>`, and `<h2>`. These tags, along with `<p>` for paragraphs and `<div>` for division, structured the website's layout effectively.

### 2. Validating Code with ChatGPT

For code validation, I relied on ChatGPT to ensure that my HTML code adhered to best practices and standards. ChatGPT provided valuable feedback, helping me refine my code for improved readability and maintainability.

### 3. Applying SEO Practices

In addition to structuring the HTML content, I paid close attention to implementing SEO practices. This involved using appropriate `<title>` and `<meta>` tags to optimize the website's visibility and ranking on search engines.

## Reflection

Day 6 was all about putting theory into practice by building a website while incorporating essential HTML tags and SEO practices. Leveraging ChatGPT for code validation streamlined the development process and ensured the quality of my code.

## Goals for Tomorrow

For tomorrow, I plan to conclude my exploration of HTML by covering miscellaneous topics. This may include revisiting some concepts, exploring advanced HTML features, or addressing any remaining questions or gaps in my understanding. Additionally, I aim to continue refining my understanding of HTML and SEO to create even more optimized and user-friendly web experiences.

Stay tuned for more updates on my web development journey!
