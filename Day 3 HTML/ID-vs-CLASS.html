   <div> To target class in css we use "."</div>
<div> To target id in css we use "#"</div>


tip
    To go to a specific section of a website you can also use id 
    <ol>
       <li> go to a website find the particular part you want to share</li>
       <li>open inspect in web broser</li>
       <li>find the section id</li>
       <li>copy it and paste it to the main link with a "#"</li>
       <li>and shre it</li>
    </ol>
    now whenever you will open the link you will be automatically sent to that part of the website  
</body>
